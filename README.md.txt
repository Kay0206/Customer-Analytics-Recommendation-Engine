Project: Customer Analytics & Recommendation Engine
Project Overview
You are working for an e-commerce platform that wants to improve customer engagement by analyzing customer behavior and generating product recommendations using their purchase and browsing data.

Datasets
	1. Customers.csv: customer_id, name, age, city, signup_date
	2. Products.csv: product_id, product_name, category, price
	3. Purchases.csv: purchase_id, customer_id, product_id, purchase_date, quantity
	4. Browsing.csv: session_id, customer_id, product_id, view_timestamp

Project Goals & Requirements
	1. Customer Segmentation:
		a. Group customers by city and age brackets (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, 36-50).
		b. Calculate average purchase value and total number of purchases per segment.
	2. Product Popularity:
		a. Find the top 10 most purchased products overall and per category.
		b. Identify trending products based on recent browsing activity.
	3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):
		a. Calculate total revenue generated by each customer.
		b. Rank customers by CLV and identify top 5%.
	4. Recommendation System (Rule-based):
		Recommend products to customers based on:
		a. Products frequently purchased together (market basket analysis — using simple join and groupby).
		b. Browsing history of customers (suggest popular products in categories they viewed but haven’t purchased).
	5. Data Quality Checks:
		a. Handle missing or inconsistent data (e.g., missing ages, null purchase quantities).
		b. Remove duplicate records.
	6. Save results:
		a. Output customer segments, product popularity, CLV, and recommendations to Parquet files for further use.
